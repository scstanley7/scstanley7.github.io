My name is Sarah Stanley and I am the Digital Humanities Librarian at Florida State University. I work in Strozier Library in the Office of Digital Research and Scholarship.
        
I hold a master's degree in English from Northeastern University, where I studied digital humanities, late medieval and early modern women's writing, and digital textual editing. I currently serve on the technical council of the Text Encoding Initiative.
