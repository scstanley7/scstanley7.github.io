      <p>My primary goal as an educator is to teach students the process of learning, whether that’s through reading a text closely, evaluating information that is presented to them, constructing effective search queries, or revising their own beliefs as they get new information. I also want to teach students how to effectively communicate the things they have learned about the world or know about themselves. English education is fundamentally about communication–whether that be through interpreting information provided to you or effectively communicating out to others. I want students to come out of my classroom with multiple communication strategies for different areas of their lives, whether it be their family lives, social lives, professional lives, or as citizens.</p>
      <p>Since my primary goal is teaching students effective communication, I believe that students need to do most of the talking. I prioritize group work, discussion, and collaboration in the classroom. I believe that my role as a teacher is to structure the classroom environment such that students can communicate effectively. My planning and preparation includes envisioning what group activities or discussions will look like on the ground: How do I set expectations to best facilitate learning? How do I need to tailor them to accommodate specific student needs? Do I need to designate roles to ensure optimal communication? I also believe that my role as a teacher involves primarily “stage setting.” For example, if I know the class is about to discuss a text, I set up my direct instruction in a way that sets the tone for what group discussion ought to entail. Once I have done this preparation work, I like to step back to allow the students to take the lead in their inquiry.</p> 
      <p>In addition to teaching communication in the physical classroom space, I also try to use the modes of communication that are most pertinent to students’ lives in the classroom, especially technology. Students are often expected to understand technological skills and digital communication etiquette despite the fact that no one has taught them. I try to explicitly incorporate technology, especially genres of digital communication, into my lessons. I plan to teach rhetorical analysis of emails both as a reader and a writer. I also want to incorporate rhetorical analysis and content evaluation of social media posts, digital news sites, and other online media to better equip them to understand these media types.</p>
      <p>I also have a discursive and collaborative approach to my assessment philosophy. I believe that students should be actively reflecting on their own progress, especially when it comes to writing and interpreting texts. A chronic problem that students have is that they don’t want to engage in revision, especially if it requires that they read the dreaded “red pen” comments on a paper. My goal as a teacher is to get them to see drafting, revision, and feedback as a way of refining their rhetoric rather than as a means to write “correctly.” I want them to ask, “How did this piece of writing resonate with its audience? How could the point be more effectively communicated?” Getting students to the point where they ask these questions of themselves requires a much more student-driven and reflective approach to assessment than typical summative assessments, but I believe that it is important to encourage students to enter that mode of self-reflection.</p>
